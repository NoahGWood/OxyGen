# OxyGen
OxyGen is a chemical oxygen generator based off a prototype that was originally designed as a last-ditch effort to save pilots and astronauts from hypoxia by generating life saving oxygen. I have been sitting on this design for a few years, but after hearing about the global oxygen crisis affecting under and undeveloped and rural areas the hardest, I realized the portability that makes this system perfect for aircraft would also make it great for these areas where transporting large tanks of oxygen might not be feasible. As a bonus, the chemical compounds are widely available (you probably already have everything you need!), and produces a clean/green, non-toxic and safe byproduct of water!

## The most basic explanation video necessary

No this is not my video, but give it a watch. Neat, right? It's using a catalyst (the yeast) to cause very rapid decomposition of H2O2 into H2O.

## Is this safe?
The most important question, unfortunately it's difficult to answer. See, H2O2 produces O2, but before it does that it first releases 2 individual oxygen atoms. These are called free radicals, you might have heard the term used in some pop-sci stuff. Basically, without another Oxygen atom to bond to, Oxygen is going to bind to the closest atom it can. Now, the reactivity of oxygen which makes it so incredibly dangerous as a mono structure also makes it incredibly unlikely that you would produce a significant amount of these mono oxygen atoms and even less likely that you would inhale or otherwise come into contact with them before they reacted with the atmosphere or another oxygen atom, etc.

The far greater danger comes from the H2O2 itself. By nature it is unstable because it has an extra oxygen atom, H2O is stable, H2O+O has that free radical oxygen we talked about earlier. This is why products like oxyclean exist, oxygen bleaches, they utilize that oxygen atom to bind to whatever it comes into contact with because it's in an uhealthy relationship and ready to break up with the water molecule in search of something better. If that something better is biological material it will do extreme damage, pretty much anything it comes into contact with is going to die, it's pretty effective. This is why you typically buy peroxide at 3% rather than 95%, one you can put on cuts, it might sting but it won't kill you; the other would cause severe burns, shock, coma, and possibly death.

Now, our entire chemical reaction involves mixing yeast (or really any kind of granules to act as a catalyst) with peroxide. This causes the oxygen atoms to be released because they get bumped out, try to grab another oxygen and wind up forming a new molecule (O2) that then can't bond with the water and is released where it eventually bubbles out of the solution. All is fine and dandy, except now we have a bunch of bubbles and with bubbles comes bubbles popping which splashes our chemical soup around. In my original design, this wasn't an issue because the benefit of the oxygen (not being guaranteed to die) far outweighed the risk of inhaling 3% H2O2 (probably won't kill you, will likely give you mild scarring and a bad case of pneumonia).

For general usage however, special care needs to be taken to ensure that only the oxygen which is produced winds up being breathed in by a patient. This can be accomplished in a number of ways using specialized filters, vapor traps, etc. but I think the most important part of any solution (which, ideally would implement multiple safety measures) is to ensure that you start the process with a dilute solution of H2O2 and not with a concentrate.

## How much oxygen can this produce?
In short, the max volume of oxygen produced by decomposition of 1 gram of H2O2 (at 1 atmosphere of pressue) is [~0.37L](https://socratic.org/questions/how-many-liters-of-oxygen-will-be-obtained-from-the-decomposition-of-1-g-of-h2o2).
Conversely, to produce 1 liter of oxygen you need a minimum of 2.7 grams of H2O2.

## Is this a cost effective method?
This is an important consideration along with a number of other factors, and the question is really a matter of how much oxygen do you need and for how long? For example, oxygen flow rates of 20-60L/minute are becoming a common method to treat COVID-19, as you can imagine however this requires a lot of oxygen!

To support someone on the 60L/minute regimen for 24 hours would require a whopping 86,400L of oxygen, or 233.28 Kg (approx. 515lbs!) of H2O2 - roughly 52 gallons which needs to be scaled up dependent on the concentration of peroxide you're purchasing. Standard/household 3% peroxide can generally be found for about $10-15/gallon and we can quickly see that we'd be looking in the range of $167k/day to utilize H2O2 for this specific form of oxygen therapy.

On a 20L/minute regimen, 28,800L of O2 are required which equates to 78Kg (171 lbs), 17 gallons, or ~$6,000 per day worth of 3% H2O2.

To be clear however, these large volume regimens generally require multiple tanks to ensure a continuous flow of O2, whereas standard oxygen flow rates tend to be 1/2 - 5 liters per minute. That gives us a range of 720 - 7,200 Liters per day or approximately 2-20Kg (4-42 lbs), 0.4-4 gallons, or $15-$1,500/person/day of a 3% concentration.

So while this would not be recommended to replace the total oxygen supply of a hospital, it could be stored and utilized as both an emergency backup source of O2, as well as can be utilized cost-effectively today to alleviate some of the demand on oxygen supplies.

## Best use cases
The absolute best use case for this form of oxygen generation is for emergencies where medical grade oxygen is not readily available.

Due to the low cost for small volumes, it is likely that this would also be a useful alternative for someone who is on a low level of oxygen (0.5-2L/minute) or someone whose oxygen needs are more transient or temporary in nature.

## Ways to make it more cost effective?
The most cost effective you could possibly make it would be by paring this with the Rice Reactor - a solar device which produces pure H2O2 using sunlight, water, and air. In theory, this would allow you to produce an unlimited amount of oxygen for nothing but the initial setup costs. This might actually prove useful for industrial oxygen generation in the future.

## More?
There will be more information to come, patience is a virtue.
